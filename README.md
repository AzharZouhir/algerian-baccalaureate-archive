### 🗂️ Folder & Naming Structure | هيكل المجلدات والملفات

The repository is organized to be as clear and user-friendly as possible. The structure is:

`Subject / Stream / YEAR-SUBJECT-STREAM-TYPE.pdf`

-   **Subject:** The academic subject (e.g., `history-geography`, `arabic-literature`).
-   **Stream:** The student's specialty (e.g., `scientific-stream`, `literature-and-philosophy`).
-   **Filename:** Contains all information (Year, Subject, Stream, and Type) to make every file unique and self-describing, preventing download overwrites. For example: `2023-arabic-literature-scientific-stream-exam.pdf`.
